## MoneyStream and Bitcoin

MoneyStream is an implementation of electronic cash as envisioned in the bitcoin whitepaper.

* The whitepaper begins 'Commerce on the Internet...'. Monetizing the internet, as with MoneyStream, was always intended as a primary use for Bitcoin.
* '... small casual transaction...' are MoneyStream bitcoin micropayments as cash, low value payments.
* '... loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services' is lamenting the high cost doing business on the internet with credit cards, not just the monetary cost but also the loss of privacy. Streamable cash for streaming content as exemplified in MoneyStream demostrates the applicability of Bitcoin to internet commerce.
